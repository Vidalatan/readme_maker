## Description
<!-- Here you should enter a little about your project. -->

A README Maker that utilizes [inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme) and [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch). The README Maker guides the user through several prompts to allow them to conveniently make a professional looking README file. It includes all sections you would commonly see, as well as a couple of extra sections in case the user wants to add additional content.
